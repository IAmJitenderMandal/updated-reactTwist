            Choosing what brand of baby products to use for your child can seem
            like an overwhelming decision. There are so many alternatives. Some
            focus on aesthetics, some on technical gimmicks. We know that for
            you, the wellbeing of your baby is always the focal point. That’s
            why we want you to be able to give your baby the time and the
            attention he or she deserves, without the burdens of everyday life
            coming in the way.

            Twistshake aspires to develop products that are simple and safe to
            use, yet also offers an appealing design. We are of the opinion that
            aiming for functionality does not mean that we can ignore
            aesthetics, and our designers are always looking for ways to combine
            practicality with eye-pleasing design. We have won several awards
            regarding design and functionality which for us is a confirmation
            that we develop safe, functional and appealing products. Babies are
            unique. They all have their individual needs, and these change at
            the same fierce rate that the babies themselves grow and develop.
            Our goal is to become experts in all the phases babies go through.
            When a child is faced with new challenges we want to be there to
            assist him by way of our innovative and safe line of products.
            Manufacturing articles aimed at babies is synonymous with an immense
            responsibility. We guarantee products of the absolute highest
            quality through compliance with all the legal quality controls, as
            well as through regular internal check-ups and quality inquiries.
            This mentality permeates not only the manufacturing process: it is a
            cornerstone of Twistshake’s entire business.

          <h1 className="para-title">Our history</h1>
          <div className="para">
            In 2011 I was babysitting my aunt’s son. This task demanded full
            attention and it quickly became clear to me that I would have a
            tough time combining this with all the other things that the sitting
            involved. The biggest time-sink was the feeding: the servings came
            in intricate plastic bags, the formula clogged, clean-up was a
            hassle and when food time was over the kitchen was a complete mess.
            In the following months I was often tasked with babysitting. The
            problems I encountered the first time didn’t magically disappear,
            and being confronted with them time and time again made me think of
            ways to lessen the mountain of a work that appeared every time my
            cousin was to be fed. At that moment I couldn’t imagine that I would
            one day have the opportunity to introduce a baby bottle designed to
            specifically address these problems. As time passed my cousin grew
            out of his baby bottle, and I didn’t think more of the complications
            that can arise from preparing a bit of baby formula. Until a summer
            day not long after, when I witnessed a woman with a baby stroller.
            In the stroller, the woman’s baby is agitated, hungry and screaming.
            The stressed mother struggles hurriedly with bags of formula and
            baby bottles and before long everything is on the ground, while the
            baby is wailing even louder. I run over as fast as I can and help
            her with the clean-up while she soothes her child. I recognized the
            situation that the mother was in, and it took me back to when I had
            been babysitting my cousin. The ideas and solutions that had been in
            my mind back then immediately came back to me. It almost felt like a
            sign; the problems I had encountered as a babysitter had still not
            been solved. To ensure that I was on the right track, I discussed
            these ideas with some of my friends who are parents. They all spoke
            of the same complications. Some had their own solutions to these
            headaches, but many of them just felt dissatisfied with the lack of
            products on offer. After this inquiry I had come up with three ideas
            that eventually became cornerstones in our work at Twistshake:
            Prevention of clogging in the baby formula An effective way to
            handle servings Easy clean-up We want to create a product that is
            both practical and easy and which in itself is a whole new way to
            address the needs of parents and their children. Today, we are proud
            to present Twistshake, a baby bottle specifically developed with
            these cornerstones in mind. And it would not have happened if I had
            not encountered that struggling mother on that summer day. Vienar
