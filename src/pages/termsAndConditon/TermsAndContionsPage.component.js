            Free freight on all orders over 100 USD. For orders below that value
            an additional fee for shipping will be added to your order,
            depending on where you live and what delivery type you choose. When
            ordering to a country outside the European Union you may have to pay
            an extra tax / customs fee depending on the value / weight of your
            order. These duties are established by the country the goods are
            delivered into, and we at Twistshake do not have any influence over
            it.With reservations for stock outs and eventual price errors that
            may arise.

          <h1 className="para-title">Delivery</h1>
          <div className="para">
            Twistshake has worldwide shipping. Average delivery time is 5-12
            business days for standard freight and 1-3 days for express,
            depending on the location. If a stock balance error should arise and
            we cannot deliver your complete order, we will deliver the products
            that are in stock and charge your account for the price of the
            products delivered. Standard deliveries are made in cooperation with
            the Deutsche Post and their partners in other countries around the
            world. For Express deliveries, Twistshake will select the optimal
            shipping method, which could be either via DHL Express or FedEx,
            depending on location. We reserve the right to deny delivery of all
            products in case of price fluctuations as well as stock conditions.
            All delivery times are to be viewed as preliminary. Due to COVID-19
            we have a higher workload than normal, and we have to reserve
            ourselves because it unfortunately causes delays and extra delivery
            days. We have put in extra staff as well as re-arranged our
            warehouse to be able to better handle the new workload. Our shipping
            companies are in the same situation, and recently updated us on
            general delays in shipping to all countries, so we appreciate that
            even here you have patience and understanding that the delivery day
            can be shifted a bit. During this campaign we are receiving more
            orders than usual, which may cause a slight delay in shipping your
            order. Which may cause a delay in delivery. We apologize in advance
            if this happens to your order.
